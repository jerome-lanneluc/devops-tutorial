# Integrations sample toolchain

With this sample toolchain, you can get the same capabilities as the integrations beta features in IBM Bluemix DevOps Services. The sample is a DevOps toolchain that can be configured with GitHub, Delivery Pipeline, Sauce Labs, and Slack integrations.

The application is a simple Node.js [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) sample that you can extend. This sample code is used in a [tutorial](https://method.mybluemix.net/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_automated) that explains how to configure a toolchain to use for cloud-native development in DevOps Services and Bluemix. 

To set up and run certain stages of the pipeline, you might need to register for other tools or services. The tutorial guides you through those details.
